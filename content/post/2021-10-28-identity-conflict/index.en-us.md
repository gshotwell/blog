# Two types of identity

One of the things people find confusing about identity is that we do not have consistent social rules for how people can determine their identify. People are able to change some identities like religion or sexual orientation over the course of their life but are not typically allowed to change things like racial identity. I think part of this confusion is that the term "identity" is used imprecisely, and distinguishing between historical and declarative identities helps to clarify political disagreements around identity.

Historical identities are statements about what you've been through. When you say that you're a veteran you're saying that you've lived through a war. If you haven't actually been a soldier in a combat zone you're not a veteran and it really doesn't matter if you feel deep in your heart that you are one. The same is true of racial identities. Identifying as Black, or Indigenous indicates that you and your family have had a particular racialized experience, and if you didn't have that experience it's incorrect and immoral to identify as that group.

Declarative identities, by contrast, are mostly statements about who you are today and how you'd like to manifest in the future. Religious identities are the most obvious type of declarative identity. If someone says that they're religious, and are accepted by a religious community, they are. If you identify as Christian, and there's a community which feels that you've done the ceremonial work to count as Christian then you're Christian. Similarly if someone says they're gay then they are, and it's not really something that another person can argue with.

The key difference between these types of identity is that declarative identities can change over the course of your life while historical ones can't. There's an immutable fact which determines whether someone is a veteran, and other people can verify whether they're right when they claim to be one. If you're a veteran today then you're a veteran for the rest of your life and nothing you can really do or say can change that fact. Similarly if you're a white person and you grew up free from racial discrimination, you're white regardless of how you feel about that. By contrast declarative identities are allowed to change over time. You might grow up Christian but convert to Islam later in life and there's nothing that other people can really say to verify or dispute that identity. If you say your Muslim, other people should just believe you.

This distinction doesn't do a good job of capturing the experience of identity but it does explain most of our social rules around identity. For example I was raised in a Buddhist community and for me Buddhism is both a historical and declarative identity, and the line between the two is pretty fuzzy. However, from the perspective of social rules Buddhism is quite clearly a declarative identity. People can become Buddhists and stop being Buddhist whenever they want to, and it's not really sensible to argue with someone if they claim to be Buddhist.

# Why this is useful

The reason this is useful is that it clarifies a lot of political conflict around identity. Most of the time when people are having a fight about identity it's because they either disagree about whether an identity is historical or declarative, or because it's unclear whether someone wants an identity to be historical or declarative.

Take, for example, the conflict between transgender activists and some cis-gendered feminists. Many people today, including myself, think of gender more as a declarative identity than a historical one. If someone tells me that their a man, a woman, or some other gender identity, I take that to be a statement about who they are today and how they'd like to manifest in the future, not about what they're life has been to this point. It's not the kind of thing which is based on some external fact, and so it's not sensible to have the conversation about whether they are right or wrong about this identity.

The problem here is that for most of the twentieth century people thought about gender as a historical identity. Saying that you were a woman was a statement about what you'd been through during your life. Women lived a physical and political reality that men did not, and justice required political systems to accommodate and compensate for those different realities.

For example one of the main reasons why we have separate sports for women and men is because we think that there's some historical fact of gender which makes it unfair for women and men to compete with one another in the same league. We have the WBNA instead of a basketbal league for short people because we think of gender as a defined historical identity.
