People have invested about \$3 trillion in blockchain-based technologies globally, but it's still pretty hard to understand the value that is being produced by this technology. Can we really do anything now that we couldn't do before? Is the whole industry just a giant financial bubble or is there real value?

Most new technologies go through this phase. For example in the late 1990s the internet and e-commerce seemed like a transformative technology, but all of the examples of that technology seemed remarkably silly. Looking back on this era, it's clear that a revolution was starting, but the way that society changed was pretty different from how people thought it was going to change. For example, while brick-and-mortar retail is still the primary way that people buy things, almost nobody maintains their own computer servers.

The new thing that blockchains offer the world is that they can do three things at the same time:

1.  They can make complicated decisions

2.  They are distributed

3.  They are automated

Various pieces of technology can do one or two of these things. For example, things like Google and Facebook can make complicated decisions in an automated way, but they're centralized services. Similarly, wikipedia, or more financial markets are examples of distributed decision making, but they rely on a lot of human judgment and conversation and are difficult to automate. We also have distributed, automated things like internet protocols, but those protocols can't really complicated decisions.

Blockchains really are the first technology that can do all three of these things at the same time, but that comes at a cost. In order to enable distributed automated decisionmaking, blockchains will use more code, energy, and compute infrastructure than traditional programs. Thinking about blockchains this way makes it easier to see why they might have value. If blockchains are valuable it's either because they are able to distribute centralized decisionmaking, or because they can automate distributed process.

**Distribute the automated things**

Most of the blockchain use cases that people know about fall into the category of taking a centralized automated process and distributing it. The process by which the US federal reserve manages the money supply is
