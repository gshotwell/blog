My first data job was at a clinical trial company called DGI Clinical in Halifax. 
I was a data scientist and made $45,000 a year which was a competitive salary in 2015. 
I didnâ€™t love the job and when I started looking for my next rolw I discovered a remote-first company called Upworhty which was hiring for a  data analyst position. 
I ended up getting the job, and to my delight the salary was more than double what I was making. 

I had stumbled into one of those rare arbitrage opportunities. By working remotely I was able to earn a wage higher than almost anything in my local labour market, and my employer was simultaneouls able to save money by hiring a Canadian.
Both my employer and I were earning what's called economic profit because the trade was significantly better than our next best alternative. 
I was making much more money than I could make locally while Upworthy was paying a lower salary than what would be required to hire an American analyst. 

Arbitrage opportunities like this are rare because efficient markets will tend erode them. 
If Upworthy was able to save money by hiring in Canada, you'd expect that other firms would do the same, which would drive up the price of Canadian workers until the market reaches equilibrium.
The market for remote workers in 2015 was not, however, efficient.
There weren't very many remote companies, and there were lots of complications around hiring outside of your country.
This meant that there just wasn't enough competititon in the market to meaningfully change wages.

I was sure that the pandemic would correct this market inefficiency. 
When large companies shifted to remote work they would realize that there were significant hiring opportunities in Canada, and the administrative costs were small in comparisson to the amount of money they'd save on salary. 
This didn't happen, and Canadian employees at remote tech companies still earn 30-40% less than their American colleagues before accounting for the high cost of American health insurance. 
I've been in situations where the people _reporting_ to me made significantly more money than me, or where published salary ranges showed a 30% lower price for Candian employees at the same level. 

I can't figure out why this is happening? 
Today any US company with remote employees can replace an American worker with a Canadian one, and reduce their labour costs by 30%. 
Alternately US firms can hire elite Canadian talent just by offering their median US wage. 
If you have the budget for an American Junior Engineer you could turn around an hire a Senior or Staff Engineer for the same price. 
Why don't more companies take this bargain?

## Why is the market still failing?

I can this of a few reasons why this market failure continues.

### Bad data

The main culprit behind this market failure is bad data. 
Most companies localize salaries by buying data from somewhere like the Rand corporation, and comparing their wages to the local market. 
They will get a single distribution of salaries within a country and target some percentile of that range. 
This data is often a bit out of date, so in a rapidaly changing labour market it is going to give you a lagged number.
This creates a kind of drag on how quickly salaries will rise because most firms will be basing their salaries numbers on data that's a couple of years old.

The bigger issue though is that Canadian salaries are bimodal. 
There's a large group of people who work for local companies and don't make that much money, and a smaller group of remote workers who make significantly more. 
When a company targets the 90% percentile of the global salary range, they will end up with target which low relative to the set of remote workers.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)

df1 = tibble::tibble(type = "Local workers",
                     salary = rnorm(1:1000, mean = 2, sd = 0.1))

df2 = tibble::tibble(type = "Remote workers",
                     salary = rnorm(1:50, mean = 2.5, sd = 0.1))

df = dplyr::bind_rows(df1, df2)
ggplot(df, aes(x = salary, fill = type, color = type, group = type)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(df$salary, probs = 0.95)) +
  labs(x = "Salary", y = "Count", title = "Canadian salary distribution") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL)
```


This supposedly data-driven HR approach has never made sense to me because companies should worry more about profit and productivity than they do about matching a local labour market. 
If you can profitably hire someone at some salary you should do so even if that salary if higher than their local market. 
If Canadians really do demand lower wages, then shouldn't you freeze US hiring and only hire Canadians? 

### Information disparities

The second potnemtial reason for the market failure might be information disparity. 
Companies may be hiring mostly through their employee referral network, which will reinforce their existing geographic distribution.


### Exchange-rate risk

Finally, firms may not hire Canadians because they are worried about exchange-rate risk.
