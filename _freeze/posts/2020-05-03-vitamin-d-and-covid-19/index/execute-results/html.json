But there's still a large difference in the death rates between the two countries.\nIn Canada, 13% of resolved cases have resulted in deaths, while in Australia just 1.3% of resolved cases are deaths.\nBoth countries have high quality medical systems that weren't overwhelmed by the disease.\nThere's no real treatment for Covid-19, so public action shouldn't be able to influence the course of the disease.\n\nIt doesn't make sense that people in Canada are dying at a rate 10 times higher than Australia. So what the hell is going on?\n\nThere are a few good theories for the difference including:\n\n- Australia's Aged Care system preventing infection in the very old\n- Heat preventing viral transmission\n- Luck\n\n## The case for vitamin D\n\nOne theory that hasn't gotten enough attention, though, is that vitamin D plays an important role the immune response to Covid-19.\nMost people get their vitamin D through their skin, and if you are far from the equator, your skin can only manufacture vitamin D during the summer.\nOne [study](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=170741) of 3.4 million blood samples collected in the U.S. over the course of five years showed that vitamin D levels peaked in August and bottomed out in February.\nSince the pandemic started at the end of Canada's winter and the end of Australia's summer, average vitamin D levels would have been much lower in Canada and higher in Australia.\n\nThere's some preliminary (preprint) research that supports this theory:\n\n- A [restrospective study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3571484) in the Philippines found a significant association between vitamin D status and severe Covid-19 infections.\n- An [Indonesian](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3585561) study of 712 people found that after controlling for age, gender, and co-morbidity, vitamin D deficiency was associated with a twelve times higher risk of death.\n- UVB radiation, which the skin uses to manufacture vitamin D is [associated](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3586555#.XrA5awDBBLE.twitter) with lower death rates and case fatality rates.\n- Covid-19 appears to [vary by latitude](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311755).\n- Hospitalized male Covid-19 patients [were found](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20079376v1) to have lower vitamin D levels than controls\n\nThere are some additional factors that make vitamin D a plausible candidate:\n\n- Vitamin D helps regulate the [renin angiotensin system](https://youtu.be/Nfp4X4O87DQ?t=1499) which includes the ACE2 receptor that Covid-19 binds to.\n- Vitamin D [may bind](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0084/v1) to the  non-structural protein nsp7 on the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n- Vitamin D deficiency is common among populations at risk for Covid-19 mortality, including people of colour, the elderly, people with a high BMI, health care workers, and those in institutional settings.\n- Vitamin D reduces the risk of [other](https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583) acute respiratory infections.\n- Vitamin D deficiency is [very common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856111) in places that have been hit hard by the disease.\n\nLastly, vitamin D status would help explain some other puzzling phenomena:\n\n- Why hasn't the disease been worse in equatorial countries with relatively constrained public health resources?\n- Why are people of colour at such a [high risk](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-racial-divide-of-covid-19-patients-in-us-grows-even-starker-as-new/) for severe Covid-19 in northern latitudes?\n- Why is Louisiana doing better than New York?\n- Considering the age demographics in Florida, why isn't Florida doing worse?\n\nNow, I'm not saying that vitamin D is definitely the cause of differential Covid-19 mortality;\nit's quite likely that there's some bundle of factors that explain all of the above. But given that it's an abundant, safe, and well understood therapy, I think we should be paying attention to it.\nI'm looking forward to the results of some of the vitamin D [clinical trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334005) and am concerned that countries in the southern hemisphere are going to see worsening outbreaks as the seasons change.",
