\nWouldn't research energy be better spent reducing the overall incidence of the virus, rather than looking at relative differences between groups?\n\nThe fact is that we don't know that much about Covid-19, \nso it's possible that this isn't a complete causal model and there are things that we can change to reduce excess mortality among people of colour. \nIf we have too much certainty that this excess mortality is socially determined,  \nthen researchers won't invest time or money trying to figure out things that *can* be treated. \n\n# The vitamin D model\n\nI've been very interested in vitamin D deficiency as a potential cause of Covid-19 mortality because it's one of the best treatment candidates for widespread use.\nUnlike other potential therapies, we already have a lot of vitamin D clinical research data and we know that it's safe to consume prophylactically.\nVitamin D would also go a long way to explain why people of colour are dying at such high rates in the northern hemisphere where sunlight is currently scarce, but not in equatorial or southern parts of the world where sunlight is currently abundant.\nWhile skin colour is not the only factor that changes serum vitamin D, and race is a social category that's only loosely related to skin colour, it is the case that in most northern latitudes people with darker skin (tend to have lower vitamin D)[https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/20/bmjnph-2020-000096#ref-13] levels in the winter.\n\nIt's important to be clear about the causal model I'm proposing. \nI am not arguing for a model like this one where vitamin D is the only relevant factor: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-ecce427d6b8fb8ebd23d\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\" class=\"grViz html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-ecce427d6b8fb8ebd23d\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\\n    graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10,\\n         rankdir = LR]\\n  # several \\\"node\\\" statements\\n  node [shape = box,\\n        fontname = Helvetica]\\n  S [label = \\\"Person of colour\\\"]\\n  V [label = \\\"Low vitamin D\\\"]\\n  D [label = \\\"Excess Covid mortality\\\"]\\n\\n  # several \\\"edge\\\" statements\\n  V ->D S ->V\\n}\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInstead, the vitamin D model adds vitamin D to all the other stuff that causes excess mortality.

say?\n\nOf course none of this matters if it turns out that vitamin D is not a factor. \nSo far there have been two main strategies that point in the direction that vitamin D, or some other unidentified factor which varies by latitude, is involved in Covid-19 mortality. \n\n## Controlling for social determinants of health\n\nOne of the main strategy statisticians use to identify whether a factor is important is to control for confounding factors. \nFor example imagine if you had a dataset that showed a significant relationship between maternal weight and a child's birth weight. \nIf you had a suspicion that gestational time had some effect on both birth weight and maternal weight, you could include the length of the pregnancy as a term in the model.\nIf maternal weight is just a spurious correlation, it won't be a significant contributor to the model. \nThe basic idea is that if a parameter is an important feature of the model, then either there is a real correlation between the feature and the outcome variable, or we've missed some other important factor that would explain away the relationship. \n\nI think we should assume at the start that the virus itself is not making racial distinctions. \nGenetic factors, like sickle cells or blood type can change how a virus attacks a person, but there's \nprobably no common genetic pattern that unites all black and brown people in Northern countries.\nAs a result, it's hard to imagine a mechanism whereby the virus itself is picking out people of colour. \nWhatever effect race has on mortality is probably mediated by something like medical bias or proximity to the virus, \nand so when a study says that race is a significant predictor after controlling for *x*, *y*, and *z*, \nthat means that we're probably missing an explanatory feature. \n\nThere are two main studies that have attempted to control for social determinants of health when explaining Covid-19 outcomes:\n\nFirst, a [study out of the UK](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999v1.full.pdf) looked at NHS records and Covid-19 mortality. \nThey controlled for preexisting conditions as well as a [deprivation index](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/833959/IoD2019_Infographic.pdf) that combines income, employment, premature death, education, crime, barriers to housing, and living environment.\nWhat they found is that after controlling for all of these factors, Black, Asian, and mixed race people had about twice the Covid mortality risk as white people.\n\nThis study confirms two out of the three causal pieces of Villarosa's model of Covid mortality: proximity to the virus and pre-existing conditions. \nThe deprivation index, which captures at least some of the socioeconomic factors that lead people to be more proximate to the virus, was associated with increased mortality,\nand pre-existing conditions were also found to lead to increased mortality.\nBut since race still provides a lot of information, we know that there's a missing factor. \n\nThe second study is a [study of US veterans,](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099135v1) which found that \"Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of Covid-19 not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care.\" \nThe main outcome of this study was positive Covid diagnosis, \nand it controlled for age, pre-existing conditions, and whether someone lived in an urban or rural setting.\nThey found that Black veterans were more likely to be tested than white veterans,\nbut were about twice as likely to test positive.\n\nThis study also controls for two pieces of Villarosa's model: pre-existing conditions and healthcare bias. \nIt directly controls for pre-existing conditions, but there also is a kind of implicit control on medical bias because the main outcome was a positive test.\nLogically, healthcare bias is more important the more treatment decisions a caregiver has to make. \nGiving birth is a great example: a doctor needs to decide whether to admit someone who might have a dangerous pregnancy, whether to induce, how to monitor fetal heart rate, and at what point to intervene with an emergency C-section. \nBias creeps in at all of these points (and more); doctors might send a Black woman home when they would admit a white woman, monitor fetal heart rate less carefully, or intervene in dangerous labour a few minutes later. \nEach of these biased decisions endangers mother and child, and it's a big part of why there's a big racial gap in [infant mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388980/).\n\nBy contrast, Covid diagnosis really only involves the one decision of whether to test or not, and we can assume that racial bias would tend to lead doctors to [undertest](https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-philadelphia-positive-tests-higher-in-poorer-neighborhoods-despite-six-times-more-testing-in-higher-income-neighborhoods-researcher-says/) Black people.\nA doctor might do a Covid-19 test on a white patient with marginal symptoms, while they may send a Black patient with the same symptoms home without a test. \nSo bias in this case would reinforce, rather than undermine, the finding that Black and Hispanic people are at a higher risk of Covid-19 diagnosis, because the more bias there is, the fewer tests they would receive. \n\nNeither of the studies above perfectly controls for the features in Villarosa's model. \nIt's possible that the missing piece in the NHS model was biased medical care and that the missing piece in the VA model was proximity to the virus, but it should at least make you suspicious that there could be an important factor that isn't being accounted for in the standard way of thinking about racial gaps in health outcomes.\n\n## Mendelian Randomization\n\nA [recent study](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/20/bmjnph-2020-000096) provides a strong argument that the missing factor is vitamin D. \nThe study uses a technique called mendelian randomisation, which requires a bit of explanation:\nIn the ideal world, we would answer the question of whether vitamin D deficiency increases your risk of dying of Covid-19 by controlling for vitamin D in the model, but we don't have  information about everyone's vitamin D levels. \nMendelian randomization is the idea that if you have information about something that you know is related to the thing you wish you had data on, then you can include that as a proxy. \nIn this case we know that people with darker skin [tend to have lower vitamin D levels](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/20/bmjnph-2020-000096#ref-13) than people with lighter skin, and that that probably gets worse as you move north. \nThe intuition here is that the skin's ability to synthesize vitamin D is less important in Florida than Wisconsin because intense UVB radiation is abundant for most of the year.\nSo this study uses race + latitude as a proxy for vitamin D levels. \n\nThe rules of mendelian randomization are that the randomizing factor can't be directly associated with the outcome, and it can't be associated with other explanatory factors. \n\nSo if you think the causal graph looks like this, mendelian randomization is appropriate:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div

L->V\\n}\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe BMJ study found that excess mortality went up as you went north.\nPlaces like Alabama, which we typically think of as having bad racial health outcomes, had lower excess Covid mortality than places like Wisconsin, which we generally assume have at least somewhat better racial health outcomes. \nThis is a pretty good argument for vitamin D's involvement because it's hard to find a story where latitude modifies other inputs into the Covid mortality.\nThis isn't to say that there's no such story, but the most obvious one is that vitamin D deficiency increases risk of Covid-19 complication. This is the main graphic from the paper:\n\n![](/img/excess_aa_mortality.jpg)\n\n\n### Does latitude modify other social determinants of health?\n\nMendelian randomization is not appropriate if the proxy also acts on your other predictor variables.\nFor instance, you might think that because there are fewer Black people in Wisconsin than in Georgia, there are also fewer Black doctors, and so implicit racial bias might be worse. \nIf that were the case, latitude wouldn't give you much information about vitamin D because it could also be acting on the other social determinants of health, which we already know are important. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-4ecd64bc3d09cf011491\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\" class=\"grViz html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-4ecd64bc3d09cf011491\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\\n  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10,\\n         rankdir = LR]\\n  # several \\\"node\\\" statements\\n  node [shape = box,\\n        fontname = Helvetica]\\n  S [label = \\\"Person of colour\\\"]\\n  A [label = \\\"Social determinants of health\\\"] \\n  V [label = \\\"Low vitamin D\\\"]\\n  D [label = \\\"Excess Covid mortality\\\"]\\n  L [label = \\\"Northern Latitude\\\"]\\n\\n  # several \\\"edge\\\" statements\\n  A->D  V->D\\n  S->A S->V\\n  L->V L->A\\n}\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne quick check we can do to see if this graph makes sense is to look at infant mortality data by latitude. \nIf excess infant mortality were higher in northern states than in southern ones, that would suggest that latitude acted on social determinants of health, because things like medical bias are likely affecting black mothers in the same way they are affecting black Covid patients.\nThis data [from the CDC](https://wonder.cdc.gov/lbd-current.html) shows that children of Black or African-American mothers die at a rate 2-3 times higher than the children of white mothers, and this rate doesn't really change by latitude. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Does latitude act directly on mortality?\n\nThe other way that mendelian randomization can be invalid is if the proxy acts directly on the outcome variable. \nIn this case, that would mean that latitude directly increased excess Covid mortality. \nAt first glance it's hard to think of how this would happen, but if you add testing to the model it becomes a bit clearer. \nIf southern states have worse testing, and in particular are less likely to test Black people, Covid deaths would be misclassified as some other kind of mortality. \nThe result would be that excess mortality would *look* lower, because Covid deaths among Black people were being under-counted.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-0d72f945d05c90bcc09f\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\" class=\"grViz html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-0d72f945d05c90bcc09f\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\\n  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10,\\n         rankdir = LR]\\n  # several \\\"node\\\" statements\\n  node [shape = box,\\n        fontname = Helvetica]\\n  S [label = \\\"Person of colour\\\"]\\n  A [label = \\\"Social determinants of health\\\"] \\n  V [label = \\\"Low vitamin D\\\"]\\n  T [label = \\\"Better testing\\\"]\\n  D [label = \\\"Excess Covid mortality\\\"]\\n  L [label = \\\"Northern Latitude\\\"]\\n\\n  # several \\\"edge\\\" statements\\n  A->D  V->D\\n  S->A S->V\\n  L->V \\n  L->T T->D\\n}\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI don't have access to any data that shows testing by race and state, but we can look at the overall testing rate to see if that varies by latitude.\nThe intuition here is that in places with abundant testing, racial bias would be less of a factor than in the places with scarce testing. \nAgain, there doesn't look to be much of a relationship here:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTo reiterate, this argument is not to dispute the factors that Villarosa proposes.\nNone of the papers about vitamin D and Covid challenge the idea that healthcare bias, pre-existing conditions, and proximity to the virus are major causes of excess mortality, and in fact all of the data supports that conclusion. \nWhat this does challenge is the idea that that's the whole story. It seems like excess Covid mortality among people with darker skin is not completely explained by socioeconomics, location, or pre-existing medical condition. And if that's true, it's good news because it means that there may be something we can do about it.\nVitamin D is a good candidate for that missing piece because it helps to explain why latitude would increase the racial gap in Covid mortality.",
